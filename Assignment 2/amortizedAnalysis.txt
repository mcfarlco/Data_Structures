1. There would be a total of 100 cost units from 40 units to append and a number of units to copy from 4 resizes.
The total cost of the copies is equal to 4 * (1 - 2^n) / ( 1 - 2) == 4 * (2^n - 1) which results in a total of 60 cost units to copy. 
Therefore the total cost would be (2^n * 4) + n - 4 cost units, resulting in an average of ((2^n * 4) + n - 4) / n and an amortized cost of O(0 + 1 + 0) or O(1)

2. There would be a total of 418 cost units from 40 units to append and a number of units to copy from 18 resizes.
The total cost of the copies is equal to n * (2(4) + 2(n - 1)) / 2 == n * (4 + n - 1) == n^2 + 3n, which results in a total of 378 cost units to copy. 
Therefore the total cost would be n^2 + 4n cost units, resulting in an average of (n^2 + 4n) / n == n + 4 and an amortized cost of O(n).
